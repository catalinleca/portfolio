export const aboutMe = [
  "I care a lot about the work itself. I like building things, improving them, and seeing them used. I tend to do my best work in environments that are challenging but well run, where decisions are made, tools make sense, and time is respected.",
  "I'm comfortable working autonomously and taking ownership end to end, but I don't work in isolation. I enjoy collaborating, thinking out loud, and being direct when something feels off or could be better. I don't need endless meetings. Clarity and trust go a long way.",
  "Teams matter to me more than titles or org charts. I try to think in terms of how this helps the team, whether that's unblocking someone, improving a process, or pushing a bit further to make something cleaner than initially planned. I'm often the person who finds time in a sprint to fix, simplify, or suggest an improvement, even when it wasn't explicitly asked for.",
