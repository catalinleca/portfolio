  "Teams matter to me more than titles or org charts. I try to think in terms of how this helps the team, whether that's unblocking someone, improving a process, or pushing a bit further to make something cleaner than initially planned. I'm often the person who finds time in a sprint to fix, simplify, or suggest an improvement, even when it wasn't explicitly asked for.",
